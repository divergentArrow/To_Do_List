This project mainly consists of python, flask(python framework), sqlite, and html/css
This is my most up-to-date version of this project
To run this, make sure to have python and sqlite installed make sure flask is installed in this directory. 
To ensure this: in command prompt navigate to 'To_Do_List' directory and type: pip install flask
Once that is done make sure you are still in To_Do_List directory and type in command prompt: python main.py
This is locally hosted so it would tell you to go to http://localhost:9001/
Once type that link into your browser, signup for a new account or you can use one of the accounts listed in the users.db file to login (Ex: Username: tester2@gmail.com  Pass: 12345) 

If you ever want to stop running program, go to command prompt and on your keyboard hit CTRL + C
This wil stop the program from running
