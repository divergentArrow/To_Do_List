Things to do to make better project:

make each user have their own table in database and add/delete from that based on who's logged in
make list clickable so adding and deleting is easier (can hover over List and click to delete item)
make pages more dynamic and fluid
make UI more friendly
Make first page after login list of things to do then go from there
maybe make all these buttons into menu item options with navigation bar on top or left side
